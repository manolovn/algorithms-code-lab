# Bellman Ford algorithm



### Complexity
Where N is the count of nodes/vertices and E the count of edges.
Time:   O(NE)
Space:  O(N)

### Solves
- SPP: Shortest path problem

### Scenario
- Negative Edge Weights
- Positive Edge Weights > 1
- Undirected Cycles
- Can`t deals with negative cycles
- Starting node A

### Tags
SPP - shortest path problem - graph - weighted graph
